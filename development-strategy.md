# Development Strategy

> `Calculator`

- This project helps you to learn and understand how you could create a calculator in different ways with a range of different applications.
- As a user you might get an understanding of how to add, divide, substract and multiply numbers.




## 0. Set-Up

__A User can see our initial repository and live demo__

### Repo

- Generated a new repository from Template and cloned it
- Turned on GitHub Pages
- Committed and pushed the changes


## 1. User story: buttons

As a user I want to see the interface and buttons, which will help me navigate.

### Repo

- This user story was developed on a branch called _buttons_.
- It was merged to master when the feature was finished.

### HTML

- Whole structure of HTML, divs with button elements with onclick attributes.
- Two inputs for better understanding of calculating the digits.


### CSS

- Styling buttons. Lovely pinky flourishing flowers background.

### Repo

- This user story was developed on a branch called _add_.
- It was merged to master when the feature was finished.

### JS

- Creating add function, that is capable of continuous adding unless "reset".
- Creating addHandler function to allow a user to use add function by providing an input.


## 3. User story: divide

As a user I want to be able to execute division of needed digits.

### Repo

- This user story was developed on a branch called _divide_.
- It was merged to master when the feature was finished.

### JS

- Creating divide function, that divides a given user-input per another user-input.
- Creating divideHandler function to allow a user to use divide function by providing an input.

## 4. User story: multiply

As a user I want to be able to multiply.

### Repo

- Creating subtractHandler function to allow a user to use subtract function by providing an input.


## 6. User story: display

As a user I want to the input and, essentially, the result to be displayed.
### Repo

- This user story was developed on a branch called _display_.

### JS

- Creating a constant displayResult, linked to the message id in HTML document, reassigned to the lastResult in order to provide the result of executed thanks to operators inputs.


## Finishing Touches

- A complete README.
- Validated code to check for any last mistakes.
